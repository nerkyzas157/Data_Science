# Data Science Projects

Welcome to my Data Science repository! This is a personal collection of various data science projects that I develop as I learn the subject. The projects range from simple data analysis to more complex machine learning tasks, reflecting my progress from a beginner to a more advanced Python programmer.

## Introduction

Hi there! I'm Nerijus. This repository is a collection of my projects, showcasing my progress and the skills I've acquired. I hope this can also serve as a resource for others who are learning Python and/or SQL and exploring data science.

## Highlighted Projects

### [Steam Data Analysis](https://github.com/nerkyzas157/Data_Science/tree/main/Steam_Data_Analysis)
- **Description:** This project creates a database and defines three tables: users, recommendations, and games. It loads data from CSV files into these tables and performs various queries and transformations on the data. The script calculates statistics such as the number of game releases per year, the percentage of games available on different platforms, average review rates, recommendation rates, and more.
- **Skills Highlighted:** SQL database creation, data loading, data querying, data transformation, aggregation functions, table renaming, column renaming, joins.

### [Handwritten Digit Recognition](https://github.com/nerkyzas157/Data_Science/tree/main/Handwritten_Digit_Recognition)
- **Description:** This project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The CNN architecture includes convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, flattening, and dense layers. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and evaluated for accuracy. Additionally, the project demonstrates the model's performance on random digit images from the web. Preprocessing is applied to resize and normalize the images, and the model is retrained with the new data. Finally, predictions are made on the new images, and the results are visualized alongside the actual labels.
- **Skills Highlighted:** Deep learning, TensorFlow, Keras, convolutional neural networks (CNN), image classification, model evaluation, preprocessing, visualization.
