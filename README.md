# Data Science Projects

Welcome to my Data Science repository! This is a personal collection of various data science projects that I develop as I learn the subject. The projects range from simple data analysis to more complex machine learning tasks, reflecting my progress from a beginner to a more advanced Python programmer.

## Introduction

Hi there! I'm Nerijus. This repository is a collection of my projects, showcasing my progress and the skills I've acquired. I hope this can also serve as a resource for others who are learning Python and/or SQL and exploring data science.

## Highlighted Projects

### [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/nerkyzas157/Data_Science/tree/main/Customer_Churn_Prediction)
- **Description:** This project focuses on predicting customer churn using the XGBoost algorithm with a dataset from Kaggle/BLASTCHAR. The dataset includes various features such as customer demographics, account information, and service usage. The data preprocessing involves mapping categorical values to numerical values, handling missing values, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. The XGBoost model is then trained on the processed data, and its performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics. Feature importance is analyzed to identify which features contribute the most to the prediction. The analysis reveals that the contract type is the most significant predictor of customer churn, with month-to-month contracts being the most likely to churn.
- **Skills Highlighted:** Data preprocessing, Handling missing values, Mapping categorical data to numerical values, Splitting datasets, Implementing and training machine learning models, XGBoost, Model evaluation, Feature importance analysis, Interpreting feature impact on predictions, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Data manipulation.

### [Handwritten Digit Recognition](https://github.com/nerkyzas157/Data_Science/tree/main/Handwritten_Digit_Recognition)
- **Description:** This project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The CNN architecture includes convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, flattening, and dense layers. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and evaluated for accuracy. Additionally, the project demonstrates the model's performance on random digit images from the web. Preprocessing is applied to resize and normalize the images, and the model is retrained with the new data. Finally, predictions are made on the new images, and the results are visualized alongside the actual labels.
- **Skills Highlighted:** Deep learning, TensorFlow, Keras, convolutional neural networks (CNN), image classification, model evaluation, preprocessing, visualization.
